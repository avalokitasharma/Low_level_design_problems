# Low_level_design_problems

#### Low level design and in-memory simulations of real-world products.
 - Outlines core functional requirements
 - Handles concurrency using Read/Write mutexes as needed.
 - Added extensibility for future features using abstractions, modular code and interfaces.

#### These are some of the most used design patterns throughout the implementations.
 - Singleton 
 - Factory
 - Abstract
 - Strategy
 - Command
 - State
 - Chain of responsibility

#### Clean code concepts are ways to keep your codebase modular, extensible, readable.
 - SOLID
 - DRY
 - YAGNI
 - KISS

 Opinionated view disclaimer: Clean code concepts and design patterns need not be learnt through reading articles. Code enough problems, design patterns will apear and you will be writing clean code rules from first principles which would resemble a lot like these ones.
